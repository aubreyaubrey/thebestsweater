##### Staring At The Sun

---

If you keep staring at the sun, 

---

you won't see

---

What you have become, 

---

this can't be

---

Everything you thought it was

---

Blinded by the thought of us, so

---

Give me a chance 

---

I will fuck up again

---

I warned you in advance

---

But you just keep on 

---

staring at the Sun
